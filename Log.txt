Bug1: 

Code: 
stringCurrent = queryStrData(hlxID, strID, startDT,endDT)
Features = queryFeaData(FeatureList, startDT,endDT)

If the last query was unbuffered, make sure it finishes before
InterfaceError. 

Not able to run these two queries sequentially.

Solution:
Put string and features query into single function, dig into 'why'

Bug2:

with mp.Pool(3) as pool:
        results = pool.map(test, strings)

Multi-processing operation has problem with python 3, had solution but forgot,
need solve again and record the solution this time. [Canopy's issue?]

Bug3: table not able to join due the lost of connection, need figure out reason
and fix

To-Do:
1. join table, to avoid missing data problem, or use hourly data, not min...but
would like to keep min level data
2.
