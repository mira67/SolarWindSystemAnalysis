Bug1: 

Code: 
stringCurrent = queryStrData(hlxID, strID, startDT,endDT)
Features = queryFeaData(FeatureList, startDT,endDT)

If the last query was unbuffered, make sure it finishes before
InterfaceError. 

Not able to run these two queries sequentially.

Solution:
Put string and features query into single function, dig into 'why'

Bug2:

with mp.Pool(3) as pool:
        results = pool.map(test, strings)

Multi-processing operation has problem with python 3, had solution but forgot,
need solve again and record the solution this time. [Canopy's issue?]

Bug3: table not able to join due the lost of connection, need figure out reason
and fix

To-Do and Problems:
1. join table, to avoid missing data problem, or use hourly data, not min...but
would like to keep min level data
2. [Better with smoothing technique, temporal factor, why Jan, Feb has lower estiamtion accuracy]
3. Not all strings has very high estimation accuracy, why?

For next step:
run all strings and make summary of the variance results and fault detection results 
for all strings, the impact from variance coverage to fault detection.

How to make more accurate model?
