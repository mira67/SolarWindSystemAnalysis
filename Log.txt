Bug1: 

Code: 
stringCurrent = queryStrData(hlxID, strID, startDT,endDT)
Features = queryFeaData(FeatureList, startDT,endDT)

If the last query was unbuffered, make sure it finishes before
InterfaceError. 

Not able to run these two queries sequentially.

Solution:
Put string and features query into single function, dig into 'why'
